Main Components of the App
The major components of the Hotel Reservation Application will consist of the following:

CLI for the User Interface. We'll use the Command Line Interface (or CLI for the user interface. For this, we'll need to have Java monitor the CLI for user input, so the user can enter commands to search for available rooms, book rooms, and so on.
Java code. The second main component is the Java code itselfâ€”this is where we add our business logic for the app.
Java collections. Finally, we'll use Java collections for in-memory storage of the data we need for the app, such as the users' names, room availability, and so on.
